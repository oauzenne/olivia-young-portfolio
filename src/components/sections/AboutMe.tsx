        <p>
          Hello! I'm Olivia, a passionate Frontend Developer and Technical
          Project Manager with over 8 years of experience creating beautiful,
          functional, and user-centered digital experiences. My journey in tech
          began with a deep love for crafting interfaces that not only look
          stunning but also solve real problems. Today, I thrive at the
          intersection of development and management, bringing a unique
          perspective that bridges technical expertise with strategic vision.
          What sets me apart is my ability to speak both languages fluently -
          translating business goals into technical requirements while ensuring
          developers have the support and direction they need to succeed. I
          believe in leading by example, coding alongside my teams when needed
          and championing best practices in everything we build. When I'm not
          crafting code or managing projects, you'll find me exploring new
          technologies, contributing to open source, or mentoring upcoming
          developers. I'm always excited about connecting with like-minded
          professionals and exploring new opportunities.
